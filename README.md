# BibTex Wordpress Plugin
It is essential for projects within a university context to publish there publications on a website. This plugin should make this process to be carried out with a minimum of effort and time. Furthermore it offers the facility to filter, open and manage there publications.

## Key Features
*   import of BibTex and representation in HTML
*   post publication on BibSonomy
*   dynamic listing of publications (from BibTex and/or BibSonomy) in pages/posts
*   admin interface to configurate the plugin

## Framework
Two of the most popular frameworks for Wordpress Plugins are Herbert and WordPress Plugin Boilerplate 

### [Herbert](https://github.com/getherbert/herbert)
* structured and standardised approach to building wp plugins
* key features of Herbert framework is it allow you to use the power and effectiveness of Laravel’s Eloquent ORM to handle your database queries. So now you don’t need to stuck with the WordPress Database Object ($wpdb).

### [WPPB](wppb.io)
* a standardized, organized, object-oriented foundation for building wp plugins
* based on the Plugin API, Coding Standards, and Documentation Standards
* uses a strict file organization scheme that correspond both to the WordPress Plugin Repository structure, and that make it easy to organize the files that compose the plugin
* no documantation but some tutorials available [here](https://www.sitepoint.com/wordpress-plugin-boilerplate/) or [here](https://www.slushman.com/guide-using-wordpress-plugin-boilerplate/)
* generator under wppb.me

Even WPPD has no official documentation, I would prefere using it because of the simplicity and better support. Beside that it gives a good structure and enough independency.
